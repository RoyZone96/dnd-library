<h1>DnD Monster Library</h1>
<p>Explore a wealth of spells and beastiaries with this ever-expanding app which takes you into the equally expansive world of Dungeons and Dragons</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Tabletop is fun, but buying many books for it is not. That is what drove me to create a codex for players and dms alike to look up spells and monsters alike. Who knows? There might be even more to come in my codex app.</p>
